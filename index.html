                <h1>Got accepted to KTH</h1>
                <h2>And so far it's awesome!</h2>
                <p>
                    So I just got into KTH, Swedish Royal Institute of Technology. Which is one of the two greatest technology universities in Sweden. KTH is obviously a tad better than Chalmers, the #2 university.
                </p>
                <p>
                     So far it's been a very positive experience. The facility is modern and doesn't lack power outlets. The courses feel rigid and serious (and hard). And lastly the people. The people there are super cool and nice. Couldn't be more happy with my choice this fall.

                <h1>Site updated!</h1>
                <h2>Flexboxe'd, HTML5-tagged & mobile friendly!</h2>
                <p>
                    So I got an urge to fix the last few things with the fite before I went to bed. The last couple of days I have started to rewrite the site in flexbox and HTML5. As well as making it mobile friendly. Which basically means that I replaced divs with different classes with propper HTML5 tags such as, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> for the blog entries and <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> for the main page. If I'm not mistaken this is beneficial for search engines and screen-readers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've also decided that I wont bother supporting old browsers at all (I will still support the different major browsers). It's both more fun and convenient to use newer technologies. This was not my own idea, rather I was linked <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/tohell">this article</a> after making a thread on reddit asking why I should use anything else than flexbox when I can. Afther which I drew the conclusion that I wont bother supporting stone age technology. Both because it's tedious and because I will be pulling my weight help push people to upgrade their browesers. And to push corporations to update from Windows XP and its ancient IE browser!

                <h1>Damn, CSS is tricky...</h1>
                <p>
                    So i just managed to solve a irritating bug with the site, where I could not get the footer to properly stick to the bottom of the page.<br>
                    My solution was:
                </p>
                    <ol class="general-list">
                        <li>Use the somewhat standard "sticky footer" implementation. You wrap everything above the footer in a "wrapper" div. This includes the header. The wrapper should have a min-height of <code>calc(100vh - [footer pixel height])</code>.<br>You can find the height by either specifially setting it (watch your paddings and margins), or by inspecting it with your browsers developer tools.<br>Consult <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/sticky-footer/">CSS-Tricks</a> guide for a propper solution that works across older browsers as well.</li>
                        <li>Remove the vertical margins on the footer content! Use padding intead.<br>This was the mistake I made that made sticking the footer to the bottom much more difficult than it had to be.</li>
                        <li>Prepare to get screwed by CSS. Inspect everything with the developer tools of choice and don't give up!</li>
                    </ol>
                <p>
                    Next time ill update the layout of this site, including making CSS responsive for mobile. Im currently learning alot on CSS layouts over at TeamTreeHouse!

                    On this site I'll write about everything development related. Even though the topic of this blog will be 90% <strong>Web Development</strong> I might write about other kinds of IT related stuff. Everything ranging from IT-politics, App and Desktop Development.
