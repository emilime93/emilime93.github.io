                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is Emil Lindholm Brandt. I'm a Swedish guy from a southern suburb to our capital Stockholm. My father has always been interested in computers and been hosting and making websites when I was little. Therefore it became a second nature to me to be around computers (and at the time, advanced usage). When I got older I started playing computer games, and it didn't take long until I started to wonder how games worked. And how the computer worked in general. Why would certain actions trigger depending on which choice I made in my OS?

                    As we all know, Google is your friend. So I started looking up such things. And while it was interesting indeed I felt that it was too advanced to get into myself. But in high school I took Programming A & B classes, which was my real gameway into IT. After high school I took a distance course in Programming 1 on university level and I was hooked.

                    Believe it or not, I do have hobbies outside of technology. A Friday evening is best spent with some friends, a bunch of instruments and some nice jamming. And while it sound cliche a long brisk walk in the woods is the best way to start a day off. I also enjoy discussing and reading about politics, society and contemplating philosophical ideas.

                    At the moment I'm studying at KTH to become a Engineer in the field of Computer Science. I use this site both as a personal website and blog. I will possibly use this site as a portofio in the future when I have made a couple of things to fill such a portfolio with.
